        The global COVID-19 death toll stands at more than 1·3 million. Among
        the lives lost have been those of health-care workers, who have had
        crucial roles throughout the response and continue to serve at the front
        lines. At the outset of the pandemic, doctors warned of the potential
        implications of the virus. As the virus spread, many doctors provided
        treatment for a disease they little understood, while others contributed
        to accelerated research on potential treatments and vaccines. And as the
        COVID-19 pandemic worsened worldwide, health professionals worked
        tirelessly to provide care for patients—some even emerged from
        retirement to provide assistance.
      </p>
      <p>
        &emsp;&ensp;&emsp;&ensp;It is not possible to honour all of the health
        workers who have died from COVID-19, but in telling the stories of a few
        of the health professionals from different specialties and various
        countries who lost their lives to the disease, these short obituaries
        serve as a tribute to the many other health workers who have died in the
        pandemic. These lives are also a reminder of the ongoing dedication and
        service of those who continue to care for patients at a time when
        COVID-19 cases and deaths are increasing in many countries.

            State Medical University at a crucial moment in 1997. An expert in
            viral hepatitis, her arrival coincided with “a period at the turn of
            the century when the problem of parenteral viral hepatitis was
            especially urgent both in Russia and in the world”, said her
            colleague Elena Gennadievna Simonova, a Professor in the Department
            of Epidemiology and Modern Vaccination Technologies. “Professor
            Asratyan was an extremely popular scientist and teacher who
            extensively trained scientific personnel. She was instrumental in
            the prevention of viral hepatitis”, said Simonova.

            There is a tradition at the Faculty of Medicine at the University of
            Valladolid in Spain that when medical students reach the end of
            their studies they celebrate a last dinner with their professors.
            Although she had a leg injury as her class's event approached in
            2015, Sara Bravo Lopez was determined to take part in the
            celebration. “She kept dancing all night, happy, because we were
            finally doctors”, said her classmate Luis Cabezudo Molleda, an
            internal medicine resident at the Complejo Asistencial Universitario
            de Palencia.

            Claudia Nogueira Cardoso always made sure to keep extra medical
            supplies in her car or her bag. As she travelled around Rio de
            Janeiro, Brazil, where she lived, she offered help to people in the
            community. “She was very charitable, a friend and companion who
            always had a friendly word”, her brother Claumyr Cardoso said. “She
            must be remembered as a person who liked to help everyone.”Cardoso
            decided to be a doctor at a young age, her brother remembered,
            inspired by her own paediatrician. She earned her medical degree at
            the Souza Marques School of Medicine in Rio de Janeiro before
            specialising in endocrinology at Santa Casa da Misericórdia, a local
            hospital.

            Livia Carrion studied medicine at the Universidad de Oriente in
            Ciudad Bolivar, Venezuela, a school with the motto, “From the town
            we come and to the town we go”. She would go on to dedicate her
            career to providing medical services to neglected communities, often
            in far-flung locations. “Her sublime love and dedication to medicine
            and to helping the needy encouraged her to study and to work for 35
            years in public health, never practising private medicine”, said her
            daughter Katherine Sulbaran.

          <p>
            Nino Cassanello Layana taught his medical students what he called
            the “principle of responsibility”. He believed that students needed
            to get to know their patients on a personal level and he encouraged
            them to ask about “not just the medical problems, but what kind of
            job he does, where he lived, what about his family”, said Cristobal
            Sanchez Metz, an adult hospitalist specialising in internal medicine
            in Washington, USA, who studied under Cassanello for 3 years.
            “Teaching was in his blood and he knew how to transmit knowledge to
            countless generations of doctors who passed through his classrooms”,
            said Tomas Alarcon Aviles, a former student, who is now the head of
            neurology at Hospital Luis Vernaza in Guayaquil.

          <p>
            As a young doctor working in Sudan, Adil El Tayar became aware of
            the rising problem of kidney diseases, particularly among young
            people. Without access to transplant surgery, patients were
            dependent on regular dialysis, which disrupted their ability to work
            or study. His mission was to replace the country's largely
            privatised, fragmented transplant services with a centralised
            registry and practice. “He wanted to build this service that could
            breed excellence, whether in diagnostics or on the operative or
            medical sides”, said his cousin, Hisham El-Khidir, a surgeon working
            at the Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital in the UK.

            Mustafa Kamal was in the midst of transforming Nishtar Medical
            University when he died of COVID-19. Named the first Vice-Chancellor
            when the university was elevated from a college in 2017, he was
            working to introduce new programmes at the institution and
            overseeing the construction of a new 500-bed hospital. “He was very
            enthusiastic to really improve the medical education and health care
            in that part of the world”, said Ghulam Qadir, a graduate of Nishtar
            and now an addiction psychiatry specialist, who is the CEO of Apex
            Behavioral Health in Dearborn, MI, USA. Qadir started working with
            Kamal a year ago to improve the psychiatric training at the
            university. “You would never find another person like him. If he
            promised something, he delivered.”

            As a consultant surgeon at The Trust Hospital in Accra, Ghana,
            Richard Kisser's colleagues knew they could call him any time for
            assistance or a consultation, even after he had left work for the
            day. He was always willing to turn around and come back, said Nii
            Lante Okunka Blankson, a specialist physician at the hospital. “He
            never shied away from hard work. He volunteered to do so many
            procedures.”Kisser cultivated that work ethic from a young age,
            Blankson said. The two attended the University of Ghana Medical
            School in Accra together, where Kisser had a reputation as a quiet,
            serious student.

            As the COVID-19 pandemic battered Italy's health system in March and
            April, doctors around the country came out of retirement to assist.
            Raffaele Pempinello was no exception. When a friend of his fell ill
            with COVID-19, Pempinello, an infectious disease specialist who had
            retired in 2013, offered to help, telling his wife that a doctor
            could never refuse to treat a patient. A week later, Pempinello
            tested positive for COVID-19 and died several weeks later. “He was
            always prone to help people”, said Roberto Monarca, past President
            and current Scientific Director of Health Without Barriers, a
            network of European organisations and experts advocating for healthy
            prison environments, who worked with Pempinello on a prison health
